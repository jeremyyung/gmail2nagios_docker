Nagmanager.py general workflow:
1. Ensure Nagios server is up and running or at least that the file structure is there. (defined in nagmanager.cfg)
  -Also assumes a g2n.json file is accessible somewhere. Also specified in the nagmanager.cfg file.
2. Run Nagmanager.py and it should tell you if files were created successfully.
3. Run "/opt/nagios/bin/nagios -v /opt/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg" to verify your config files are valid.
  -Any warnings that mention the hosts themselves can be ignored. I disabled all Nagios-related host checks, since we're just checking email status updates
4. Restart nagios to apply your settings.

==MISC==
hostpoll.py: Relies on the G2N_FILE environment variable to locate the g2n.json file. 

How to verify Nagios config files:
/opt/nagios/bin/nagios -v /opt/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg
