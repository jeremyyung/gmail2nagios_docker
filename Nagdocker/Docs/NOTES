#Docker logs only shows the stderr and stdout of the container's first process. Since 
#I use 'cron -n' to run my py script in a cronjob, I need out redirect all output:

#Docker's default logging driver doesn't do log rotation. Add this in /etc/docker/daemon.json
#to use the 'local' logging driver, which has log rotation by default.
