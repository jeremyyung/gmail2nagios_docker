Writing custom plugins
----------------------
Always make sure you chmod +x the script used for plugin.

Exit codes:
To identify the status of a monitored service, Nagios runs a check plugin on it. Nagios can tell what the status of the service is by reading the exit code of the check.

0 - Service is OK.
1 - Service has a WARNING.
2 - Service is in a CRITICAL status.
3 - Service status is UNKNOWN.
